//This classic problem dates back to Roman times. There are 41 soldiers arranged in a circle. 
// Every third soldier is to be killed by their captors, continuing around the circle until only one soldier remains. 
// He is to be freed. Assuming you would like to stay alive, at what position in the circle would you stand?

// Generalize this problem by creating a function that accepts the number of soldiers n and 
// the interval at which they are killed i, and returns the position of the fortunate survivor.
// Notes:
//  - Assume the positions are numbered 1 to n going clockwise around the circle.
//  - If the interval is 3, the first soldiers to die are at positions 3, 6, and 9.
module.exports = (n, i) => {
  // put your code here
  // don't touch anything else
}
